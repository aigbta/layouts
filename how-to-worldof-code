CODING 101

First of all, a few basic tips:
1. The "language" the site uses is mainly HTML.  It also uses CSS, but this language is for style, while HTML is for structure. 
2. The best way to learn is to look at other codes.  Tessiamess has some fantastic ones!
3. Google is your friend.  You can google "border with shadow html" and find multiple tutorials.
4. Here's a handy dandy code tester.  You code in the left, press run, and it'll generate in the right.  https://www.w3schools.com/code/tryit.asp?filename=FI1023IREYWI  AND it'll also change colors if you forget a " or >.  
5. Worldof sites can be complete assholes and randomly don't accept some tags.  It's usually not your fault.

Okay, so:
HTML works in things called tags.  Tags go in < >.  If you open a tag, you must close a tag (except for a fewww exceptions.)  Different tags do different things. You can define a tag with "style."  We'll talk about that later!

STRUCTURE TAGS
<div> defines a section of text
<span> also defines a section of text, but should go inside a <div> tag, not on its own
<body> or <head> these are section markers that you might see in other codes, but that don't work on worldof sites
<p> defines a paragraph of text
<img> defines an image

STYLE TAGS (cannot be defined with style, go right in front of text you want formatted as such)
<b> defines bold type
<br> defines a line break (i.e., enter)
<em> defines emphasized text, italics 
<hr> defines a division using a horizontal line
<h1> or <h2> or <blockquote> style 

OTHER TAGS
<a> defines a link
<td> makes a table (I'll talk about that later)
<ul> makes a bulleted list (this too)
<ol> makes a numbered list
<!--- insert text here ---> Notes text that doesn't do anything in code, but gets preserved in case u need notes for yourself!  

You might also see <html> at the beginning and </html> at the end of a code.  It's not necessary for worldof coding, but is for most.  

HOW DO YOU USE TAGS? 
Like this: <tagname>content goes here!... </tagname>

So a code might look like:
<html>
<p>This is a paragraph.  <b>I bolded this section INSIDE the paragraph. Wow, bold!</b>Wooo, paragraph. </p>
<p>This is another paragraph. </p>
</html>

Pay attention to a few things:
Every tag I opened (like <p> or <html>), I closed with </html> or </p>.

HOW DO YOU STYLE TAGS?
You can style tags for a few different things-- the text, an image, or the structure of a container.  (NB: A container is the thing that holds the text/image/etc.)
Use = after style, use : after a style rules, use ; between style rules.  See below. 

The format for styling a tag goes like this:
<tagname style="styling tags"> </tagname>
Like this:
<div style="width:60px"></div>

NB: You might see a <div> or <span> tag with an id/class label.  Like <div class="container"> or <span id="title">.  These are useful as notes for yourself, but don't do much without series CSS coding (which doesn't work with worldof).  

Here are some basic style rules:
STRUCTURE
* width - for worldof sites, use %, like "width:50%;", this governs the width of the container
* height - see ^
* margin - goes OUTSIDE of a container. you can use percentage or px (pixels) for this.  use it like "margin:3px;" for 3px all around.  use "margin:auto" to automatically center a container.  use "margin: 10px 5px 15px 20px;" to do different margins on each side.  it goes like top right bottom left.  ((keep in mind your math when considering margin+container width to make sure it fits))
* padding - goes INSIDE of a container to make space between the edge of the container and the stuff inside.  percentages work here, or px, it's written the same was as margin!

FONT STYLE
* font-family - tells it what font to use.  here's a list of internet (and worldof) friendly fonts: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp.  Serif has the little edges on the font, sans-serif does not!  This is a sans-serif font.  
* font-size - define this in px
* text-align - left/right/center/justify
* color - defines font color.  see below for info on color
* text-transform: uppercase/lowercase/capitalize
* letter-spacing: i usually use this in titles to make them look more title-y.  use it with px
* line height: you can add this command to make spacing between lines lesser, using px or %

OTHER STYLE-ISH STUFF
* border - write it like "border:5px solid red;" the first piece says how thick it is, the second could be solid/dotted/double and the last is a color.  See below for info on colors!
* background - use it in two ways: with a color like - "background: red;" or with an image like - "background: url(link-to-image);"  
* background-repeat - repeat/no-repeat; this goes WITH a background tag and says if it should repeat or not
* background-size - auto = as the image is sized; cover = covers entire container; you can also define with px or %

IMAGES
Images are governed with the <img> tag.  I'd recommend getting an imgur account, uploading images there, and then getting a direct link from imgur.  

Image coding has a few rules:
src = the image url
alt = if the url won't load
title = shows up when u hover over an image

so it looks like: <img src="https://s.imgur.com/images/logo-1200-630.jpg" alt="imgur logo" title="here's an example">

Img code does not require an end tag, you don't need </img>.  

You can also use style rules on image tags!  Like this:
<img src="url" alt="imgur logo" style="width:50%; border: 5px solid black;">

COLOR
Colors are great!  You use a "color: red;" tag to make font different or "background: #dddddd" to make a background a different color!

HTML understands basic color words, like red, blue, black, green, orange.  You can also use http://htmlcolorcodes.com/ to find a more specific color.  You insert a "hex color" (that's what these are called" using its 6-letter/number code.  "color: #A84646;"  is how it would look. 

LINKS
Links are great.  They're governed with <a>  Like this: <a href="url"></a>
They can also have title to make it with info on hover. <a href="url" title="title goes here">
You can put text in there: <a href="url">This text will be hyperlinked.</a> or an image like <a href="url"><img src="image url"></a>.  

Links can also be used as anchors.  This lets you click a link to jump down to a section of the page.  You name the section like this: <a name="top">Here's the Top of the Page</a>.  You link to it like <a href="#top">.  I used this in the staff book & the class book in the library!  

TABLES/BULLETTED LISTS/NUMBERED LISTS
Tables and ordered lists kinda go inside each other.  <table> is the big mama tag.  then <tr> makes a new row and <td> makes a cell Like this:
<table>
<tr>
<td>data cell 1</td>
<td>data cell 2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>data cell 3</td>
<td>data cell 4</td>
</tr>
</table>

Bulleted lists/numbered lists do pretty much the same way -- use <ul> for bullets, <ol> for numbered and <li> for each list item. Like this:
<ul>
<li>bulleted item 1</li>
<li>bulleted item 2</li?
</ul>

HOW DO I COMBINE THIS STUFF?
You'll use <div> tags to make a container.  Look at this code: https://github.com/aigbta/layouts/blob/master/arithmancy-lesson.html. It's a lesson code, probably similar to what you'd do for your own lessons!  I also made Joel Thayer's Arts & Crafts, if you want that one too, it'll eventually be on the link i put at the top.  

 I'm gonna explain some pieces of it to explain how to combine this stuff. 

It's got one main <div> guy, and that makes that green background. This:

<div id="container" style="
    background:url(https://i.imgur.com/1vJ0dzd.jpg); 
    background-repeat:repeat;
    margin:auto;
    padding:2%;
    width:94%;">

Then, each of the paper background sections is a new <div> INSIDE that main one.  This is the code for each of those:
<div id="container2" style="
    background:url(https://i.imgur.com/Wym4d2h.jpg);
    background-repeat:repeat;
    margin:auto;
    padding:4%;
    width:90%;">

Inside THAT are a few <div>s.  The first is for the title:
<div id="title" style="
    font-family:'Trajan', serif;
    font-size:35px;
    text-align:center;
    letter-spacing:5px;
    color:#214130;
    text-transform:uppercase;"> TITLE HERE </div>

Then I used an <hr> which!! like many things! can be styled.  Google <hr> styles for some examples and use those!

In a new <div> after the title but still inside both the background and the sections, I made one for the text of the lesson.  This is that code:

<div id="text" style="
    font-family:'Trajan', serif;
    font-size:18px;
    text-align:justify;
    color:#2C3206;
    display:inline-block;
    text-indent:5%">

The "display:inline-block;" here makes it so the images format the way I wanted them to, and the "text-indent" makes the text... indent.  

You'll also see inside this <div> is a <span> tag.  This makes the text within the <span> format slightly differently, as in for when the professor speaks.  

this is that code:
span class="speech" style="color:#214130;text-shadow:1px 1px 5px #8A8A79;">speech text </span>

When all the text was done for that section, I ended it with a </div>.  I also put a <br> in there to make space between the paper section and the next paper section-- you could also do this with a bigger margin, but that can be hard with the margin:auto bit.  So I used a <br> which is just a blank line.

annnd you can see in the code there's also a bit of an image code in there too... At the very end, I used </div> to end the final big mama <div>.  

i think that's all i've got for now??? i hope this isn't too overwhelming.  

OKAY SO... NOW WHAT?
1. Go look at some other codes.  Here's my repository: https://github.com/aigbta/layouts.  Copy the code from there into the code viewer i put up there earlier!
2. Let me know if you have questions!  This is kind of a lot... but... ahhh it's all important.  
3. Remember, google is your friend.  W3schools is an incredible site with lots of html help.  Google google google.
