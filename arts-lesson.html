    Joel Thayer slid into the Arts and Crafts cabin quickly, deftly inserting himself between a pair of students and depositing the box he had carried in on their table.<br><br>
<span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Hey everyone,”</span> he said, grinning ruefully, <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“sorry I’m late. Not a great way to start off your first class, I know.” </span>He nodded and flashed a smile briefly to the counselor that had accompanied the group then turned back to unpacking the box, not waiting to watch them leave. He pulled out several containers full of thick clear gel and deposited them onto the table, then spun around and dug through the cabinets of the room until he found several dozen small jars.<br><br>

<span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“So what we’re doing today,” </span>he said eagerly, organizing a space in front of him on the table, <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“is making fingerpaints.”</span> He glanced around the room with raised eyebrows. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Now I know some of you are going to think that fingerpaints are baby stuff but oh man,” </span> he laughed, <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“are you ever wrong. Fingerpaints are awesome, you’ll see.” </span><br><br>

Joel blinked and did a quick tally of the campers in the room. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Alright everyone’s actually here, great. Before we get into the arts and crafts stuff I guess I should probably introduce myself,”</span> Joel grinned. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“My name’s Joel, I’m the Arts and Crafts instructor here. I also run Thyrsus Thrifts by the lake, if any of you have seen that yet, and manage the camp farm.” </span>He held up a hand to quell the murmurs before they started. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Before you ask yes, we do have goats- which I’m sure you were all wondering,”</span> he laughed,<span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;"> “and yes we’ll probably end up going over to the farm a few times during our meetings. I’ve got a few things planned for later in the semester that I think you’ll like in regards to that.”</span><br><br>

Cracking his knuckles loudly, to the dismay of one girl nearby, he set about dividing the contents of the larger containers into the jars.<span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Does someone want to grab me the bag of popsicle sticks from the drawer over there? No, the one below that. Yeah, that’s it.” </span>He caught that bag that the 11-year old tossed to him deftly and grinned. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Thanks, nice throw. Alright so,” </span>he reached back into the box and pulled out a large pack of food coloring vials in various shades.<span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“The first thing we have to do is mix our colors. This clear stuff is the base for the paint, but as you can all see it’s pretty boring right now. I’m going to mix a few sets of basic colors, but for now everyone grab a jar of this stuff. I’ll mix a bunch more colors, but everyone can also make their own custom color in their jar- if you like a color that someone else has made, you can probably ask them to use some of it on your own paintings.”</span><br><br>
He swooped across the room and scooped up a large stack of plain white paper, then distributed it in smaller stacks among the tables as everyone got a jar of clear paint. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“It only takes a few drops of food coloring,”</span> he called to them warningly. <span style="color:#356049; font-weight:bold;">“Try to start out with just a little bit at first. You can always add more if you want after you stir the color in with the popsicle sticks, but you can’t take it out after it’s in there. Or go for it and put a bunch in honestly, it’s your paint. Just make sure there’s food coloring left for everyone else. And for me,” </span>he added as an afterthought, snagging a piece of paper for himself.

    ACTIVITY</div>
    <hr>
    Write an RPG about mixing and using your fingerpaints. What color did you mix in your own jar, and how much food coloring did you use in it? What did you end up painting afterwards? Did you borrow paint colors from anyone else? How did you like fingerpainting?
