<p><span style="color:#daa520;">“Hello, everyone,”</span> a cool voice said from the back of the room.  Eoin entered, passing through the rows of students already seated and tittering.</p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">“You should be in Wilderness Survival I.  If that is not correct, this is your time to leave respectfully.”</span>  She looked around, waiting for anyone to depart.  No one did, which was not a surprise.  Beginning the class this way was more of an intimidation tactic than anything more functional.</p>
 
<p>She walked to the front of the tent, where a wide tree stump grew out of the ground next to an old wooden table.  Eoin sat cross-legged atop the stump and looked around the room.</p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">“You’ve all survived this far.  Why do you need this class?”</span> she asked.  It was silent for a long moment.  </p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">“I asked a question.  Why are you here?”</span> she looked around, waiting for a student to answer.  </p>
 
<p>One brave human student put a hand up.  Eoin nodded at them, and they spoke quietly, looking at their desk, <span style="color:#AEB6BF">“Well, I know how to survive basically, so I don’t really need help knowing how to eat, or when to sleep.  I’m hoping this class is going to teach me skills like making fires or tents, things I don’t know yet.”</span></p>
 
<p>Eoin smiled.  <span style="color:#daa520;">“Beautiful, thank you.  Does anyone else want to give it a try?”</span></p>
 
<p>Another student began to speak without raising a hand, but Eoin didn’t stop him.  <span style="color:#AEB6BF;">“I feel like I don’t even know what I don’t know, and I’m thinking you’re going to teach me.”</span></p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">“Precisely,” </span>Eoin nodded, stepping up from her seat on the stump. <span style="color:#daa520;"> “One of the most basic things to learn about survival is knowing that you don’t know everything.</span></p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">Once, I assumed a plant that looked similar to one I recognized was the same. I fed it to my cat, Milo, and we both spent the evening completely ill--</span></p>
 
<p><span style="color:#daa520;">Knowing the limits of your knowledge is necessary to surviving.  That’s what this is all about.”</span></p>
 
<p>She looked around. <span style="color:#daa520;"> “It’s not all dark, I promise.  If you stick around, I’ll teach you to build forts and climb trees and give your enemies awful rashes.”  </span></p>
