<p>This book discusses the Greek Gods.  While there are a vast number of gods and goddesses in both religions, the uniting theme is that they are above mortals and heroes.  At times, they are the conductors of fate.  Other times, they attempt to fight fate, and cause chaos for humans.</p>
 
<p>The gods’ presence in ancient myth serves a few functions, often multiple at once.  First, they were symbols.  The image of Athena might represent wisdom or power, provided to whatever space her image is present on.  They might be used to explain fate or nature or other things that humans do not have control over. They also provide entertainment for the masses. In terms of the Greco-Roman Gods, they are often used to show different aspects of humanity.  These gods are imperfect, and held to the whims of emotion much like humans.</p>
 
<p>Because the gods are imperfect, and they invade in human history, and have emotions, there is not so much that separates the gods and men.  The gods are immortal, while humans are not.  But humans could be deified if they were true heroes, like Hercules.  The true separation between gods and men in more in mindset and function than in form. </p>

<div id="title-style" style="text-align:center;
font-size:25px;"><i><a name="sources">Sources of Mythology</a></i></div>
<p>There are a number of competing histories and stories of each god, as with myths, legends, monsters, and all ancient stories.  Part of this is the result of a diverse number of oral histories written down as myths.  Another reason, as discussed in the introduction, is that the images and stories of the gods are used for many different reasons. </p>
 
<p>Some of the best-preserved sources of mythology come down in images.  Vase paintings depict mythic creatures and gods in canonical and new situations.  The so-called ‘canonical’ mythology comes down through ancient authors.  The canon is defined because it is often repeated throughout stories and cited by authors and scholars in and just after the classical world. </p>
 
<p>Herodotus (5th c. BCE) was a historian from the west coast of modern-day Turkey.  He is known for writing about the Greco-Persian War.  It is through his Histories that we know of Aesop.  Aesop is known for his fables, which have been translated and edited many times since the sixth century BCE, when he lived in Samos as a Thracian slave (Samos is a Greek Island in the Aegean Sea). </p>
 
<p>Aeschylus (c. 525-456 BCE), Euripides, and Sophocles (both born c. 486 BCE) are all playwrights.  Only a select number of each of their works survive, but the plays provide some examples of the myths of the gods as they would be used in public forum. </p>
 
<p>Pindar (born c. 518) was a lyric poet and friend of Aeschylus.  His work is some of the best preserved of the classical poets.  He wrote songs of praise, mourning, and victory odes, which detail historical and mythic stories.  Hesoid (born c. 800 BCE) too was a poet, who wrote on farming life and the gods.</p>
 
<p>Apollonius of Rhodes (born c. 450) wrote an epic, Argonautica, which describes the hero Jason and the quest on the Argo for the Golden Fleece.  This was a complete version of the story of Jason, which had been told long before Apollonius. </p>
 
<p>Perhaps the most influential source of mythology is Homer, who lived in the ninth century BCE.  Homer’s greatest works are the Iliad and Odyssey, Greek epic poems on the Trojan War.  These poems are arguably some of the most influential works in Western literature, for the extent that they have been studied, edited, and reinterpreted. </p>
